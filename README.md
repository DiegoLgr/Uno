# Uno
Uno is a toy programing language inspired by Lox. The name "Uno" comes from it being the first language I do.
In this project we can find an interpreter and a compiler (to bytecode) for Uno developed following the book "Crafting Interpreters" By Bob Nystrom. The book can be found in https://craftinginterpreters.com/  
This is meant to serve as a learning exercise on how programing languages are implemented and in the use of c++.
